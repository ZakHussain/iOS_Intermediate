### (1) Adding_to_the_Beast_List

This app is relatively simple in that it has a UI that gives the user a space to type 
in something on their To-Do list. It then displays that on the screen. The User can 
double tap it to remove it from the list.

### (2) Bucket_list

**important note** this folder contains two “Bucket List” apps. The first “Bucket List”
does not contain the option to edit anything submitted by the user. The second, 
“Bucket_list_add_edit,”does include the edit option. Bucket List is built off of the 
same concept as the “Adding_to_the_Beat_List” app. The user adds something from their
bucket list, and that is displayed on screen. However, the main difference is that the
user can edit their submissions.

### (3) Bucket_list_refactor

This is an updated version of “Bucket_list”
  
---   
### (4) Bucket_list_refactor_Core_data

This app includes Core data, which enables storing information from the user. 
Based on the Bucket_List app, this app can now display information the user inputted 
from different sessions.  
  
---   
### (5) Name Picker

This app uses a “Picker” that allows the user to create unique names by flicking 
their thumbs against the screen to fling the slot (think of a casino machine). New 
Names can be added and saved to the app because “Core Data” was implemented.
